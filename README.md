# conway_game_of_life
Hi! This is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame.
Recently, I've been really into cellular automata and I tried making a model for the [Abelian Sandpile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model). It was a fun exercise but the display I created looked really garbage (see [here](https://github.com/minghanminghan/abelian-sandpile/)). <br> <br>
With this project I wanted to try having: <br>
  (1) Implementing the logic behind Conway's Game of Life <br>
  (2) Learning and implementing Pygame to create a better displays <br>
  (3) Having better file organization <br> <br>
In its current state, the project it is still quite incomplete. There is no user control over the simulation's initial conditions and no way to pause a run after it starts.
I'm working on increasing flexibility and user accessibility, as well as including a folder with some tests so any viewers can better understand the internal mechanics of the program. <br>
